    When working on federal policy and advocacy, profiling data by state is fairly common, but creating a report for each state can be tedious. We found that an excellent way to go about this is to combine python and InDesign.
    <br/><br/>
    With a report template in mind and an idea of which data and text elements may vary by state, use python (<span class="font-weight-bold">pandas</span>) to prepare these fields. They will be added from Excel via a mail merge. You can even test-run the report's text in python. But the best part is that with the font called <a href="https://www.fontshop.com/content/ff-chartwell-making-all-the-charts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FF Chartwell</a> you can create high-quality charts from strings of numbers and plus signs. Fortunately, those fields are easy to prepare in pandas as well.
