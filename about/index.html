        I analyze data and sometimes code things. I try to make a difference in the world. I'm especially interested in data visualization, web development, and putting data behind policy and practice.

        But that's not the full story. I've worked primarily in the non-profit sector, not just analyzing data but also directing programs and systems. I'd like to think this experience gives me a grounded lens for approaching policy and data. I'm particularly passionate and knowledgeable about work around poverty and homelessness.

        <br/>
        I did a Master's Degree in Social Work at the University of Michigan, focusing on public policy and evaluation.

        I'm also an occasional musician, so long as combining electronic sounds counts.
